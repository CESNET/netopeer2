CLI TLS support
---------------

If you enable TLS (by configuring with --enable-tls and compiling),
the TLS functionality is enabled. However, in order to make it working,
you must perform a few initial configuration tasks.

client certificate
	With every action that requires verification, you can specify
	paths to the client certificate to be used. Also, if you do not
	specify any certificate, the default one will be used. To set it
	up, use the "cert replaceown" command (netopeer-cli(1)).

server certificate verification
	In order to verify the certificate provided by the server, you
	need to specify the Certificate Authority certificates you find
	trustworthy and make them accessible to netopeer-cli. Again, you
	can explicitly specify the path to a Certificate Authority
	trusted store, or use the default directory. To add certificates
	to this directory, use the "cert add" command (netopeer-cli(1)).

Certificate Revocation Lists
	For netopeer-cli to check if a certificate was not revocated by
	its issuer, use the "crl add" command (netopeer-cli(1)) to provide
	CRLs of your trusted CAs for netopeer-cli.


Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "./certs" directory includes copies of the needed example
client certificates, which will work with the server example
certificates.
